# Animation & Transformation System Refactor - Implementation Summary

## Completed Implementation

The animation and transformation system has been successfully refactored from a target-dependent model to a composition-based architecture where actions contain and manage animations.

## Files Created

### Core Animation System
1. **scripts/controllers/actions/animated_action.gd** - Base class for all animated actions
   - Composes AnimationNode
   - Fluent API: `.over(duration)`, `.using(animation)`
   - Handles animation lifecycle

2. **scripts/infra/animation/animation_repository.gd** - Singleton for animation management
   - YAML-based animation loading
   - Programmatic registration
   - Priority-based resolution (code > character > scene > common)
   - Registered as autoload in project.godot

### Transform System
3. **scripts/controllers/actions/transform/transform_action.gd** - Base for transformation actions
4. **scripts/controllers/actions/transform/move_action.gd** - Position transformations
   - Methods: `to()`, `left()`, `right()`, `up()`, `down()`, `forward()`, `backward()`
5. **scripts/controllers/actions/transform/rotate_action.gd** - Rotation transformations
   - Methods: `to()`, `to_degrees()`, `by()`, `by_degrees()`, `clockwise()`, `counter_clockwise()`
6. **scripts/controllers/actions/transform/scale_action.gd** - Scale transformations
   - Methods: `to()`, `uniform()`, `up()`, `down()`, `x()`, `y()`

### Animation Implementations
7. **scripts/infra/animation/implementations/transform/transform_animation.gd** - Interpolation with easing
   - 13 easing functions
   - Shake effects
   - Supports Vector2, Vector3, float, Color

8. **scripts/infra/animation/implementations/state_change_animation.gd** - Fade transitions
   - Fade out → change → fade in pattern
   - Configurable fade fraction
   - Three target modes (WHOLE_NODE, INDIVIDUAL_LAYERS, SPECIFIC_LAYERS)
   - WHOLE_NODE mode prevents body bleed-through on layered characters
   - Callback for state change at midpoint

9. **scripts/infra/animation/implementations/shader_animation.gd** - Shader effects (placeholder)
   - Structure for future shader-based animations
   - Parameter animation support

10. **scripts/infra/animation/implementations/video_animation.gd** - Video/GIF playback
    - Multiple format support (VideoStream, AnimatedTexture, SpriteFrames)
    - Duration syncing
    - Looping support

### Example YAML Configurations
11. **assets/scenes/common/animations/bounce.yaml** - Bounce easing example
12. **assets/scenes/common/animations/shake.yaml** - Shake effect example
13. **assets/scenes/common/animations/smooth.yaml** - Smooth easing example
14. **assets/scenes/common/characters/me/animations/animation.yaml** - Character defaults

## Files Modified

### Core Animation
1. **scripts/infra/animation/animation_node.gd**

   - Added `apply_to(target, progress, delta)` method
   - Simplified to pure animation processing

2. **scripts/infra/animation/animation_factory.gd**
   - Updated for new API (removed target parameter)
   - Added new animation types
   - Marked as deprecated (use AnimationRepository instead)

### Legacy Animation Updates

   - Updated to new API
   - Marked as legacy

4. **scripts/infra/animation/implementations/effects/instant_animation.gd**
   - Updated to new API

5. **scripts/infra/animation/implementations/effects/dissolve_animation.gd**
   - Updated to new API
   - Marked as legacy reference

### Character Actions (Refactored to extend AnimatedAction)
6. **scripts/controllers/actions/character/express_action.gd**
7. **scripts/controllers/actions/character/pose_action.gd**
8. **scripts/controllers/actions/character/look_action.gd**
9. **scripts/controllers/actions/character/wear_action.gd**
10. **scripts/controllers/actions/character/act_action.gd** - Updated for new AnimationFactory API

### Actor View
11. **scripts/views/actor.gd**
    - Added `move()` method → MoveAction
    - Added `rotate()` method → RotateAction
    - Added `scale()` method → ScaleAction

### Project Configuration
12. **project.godot**
    - Added AnimationRepository as autoload singleton

### Demo
13. **game/demo.gd**
    - Updated to showcase new animation system
    - Examples of move, scale, and state change animations
    - Uses named animations from YAML

## Key Architecture Changes

### Before (Legacy)
- Animations directly referenced target nodes
- Animations managed by ResourceNode
- Limited animation types
- Hard-coded animation behavior

### After (New System)
- Animations are independent of targets
- Actions compose and manage animations
- Extensible animation types (transform, state_change, shader, video)
- YAML-based configuration with priority resolution
- Fluent API for building animated actions

## API Examples

### Transformations
```gdscript
actor.move().left(0.2).over(1.0).using("bounce")
actor.rotate().clockwise(45).over(0.5)
actor.scale().up(1.5).over(0.3)
```

### State Changes
```gdscript
actor.express("happy").over(0.3)
actor.pose("waving").over(0.4)
actor.wear("casual").over(0.5)
```

### Custom Animations
```gdscript
# Load from YAML
actor.move().to(0.5, 0.8).over(1.0).using("shake")

# Programmatic registration
var custom_anim = TransformAnimation.new(1.0, TransformAnimation.EasingType.ELASTIC_OUT)
AnimationRepository.register_animation("elastic", custom_anim)
actor.move().right(0.2).using("elastic")
```

## Benefits

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Animations don't need to know about targets
2. **Reusability**: Same animation can be applied to different actions
3. **Configurability**: YAML-based defaults per scene/character
4. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new animation types
5. **Fluent API**: Readable, chainable action building
6. **Type Safety**: Specific action classes for different transform types

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test all easing functions visually
2. Verify YAML loading from different priority levels
3. Test chaining of multiple animations
4. Verify state change fade transitions
5. Test transform animations on different node types
6. Ensure cleanup of shader/video resources

## Future Enhancements

### Short Term
- Hook AnimationRepository loading into AnimatedAction properly with context
- Add animation curves for custom easing
- Implement full ShaderAnimation with shader loading

### Medium Term
- Animation blending/layering
- 2D mesh manipulation for facial animation
- Timeline system for complex choreography
- Animation presets library

### Long Term
- Visual animation editor
- Animation state machines
- Procedural animation generation
- Physics-based animations

## Breaking Changes

None - the old animation system is deprecated but still functional. New code should use the new system exclusively.

## Migration Path

1. Replace direct animation calls with AnimatedAction API
2. Convert animation configurations to YAML
3. Use `.over()` and `.using()` for animation control
4. Test thoroughly, especially state change transitions

## Known Issues & Solutions

### Layered Character Fade Bleed-Through

**Problem**: When characters have multiple sprite layers (body + clothing), fading each layer independently causes the body to become visible through semi-transparent clothing during transitions.

**Solution**: `StateChangeAnimation` now supports three target modes:
- `WHOLE_NODE` (default): Fades the entire `sprite_container` as one unit - prevents bleed-through
- `INDIVIDUAL_LAYERS`: Fades each layer independently - legacy behavior, causes bleed-through
- `SPECIFIC_LAYERS`: Fades only specified layers by name

The default `WHOLE_NODE` mode ensures layered characters fade correctly without revealing underlying layers.

## Notes

- "in" is a GDScript reserved keyword, so we use `.over()` for duration
- Actions are automatically registered and queued by Actor methods
- Animations are processed by actions, not by ResourceNodes
- AnimationRepository must be registered as autoload singleton
- Default animations are loaded lazily on first use
- For layered characters, always use `target_mode: whole_node` in state change animations
