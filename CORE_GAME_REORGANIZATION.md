# Core-Game Library Reorganization - Complete

## Summary

Successfully reorganized the core-game library to provide complete view implementations while game developers only create .tscn UI files. The architecture now has a clear separation between library code and game-specific UI design.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Complete View Implementations in core-game/views/

✅ **`title_screen_view.gd`** - Full title screen implementation
- Extends BaseScreenView
- Creates TitleScreenModel and TitleScreenController
- Exports node paths for UI elements (StartButton, ContinueButton, OptionsButton, QuitButton)
- Automatically wires up button signals to controller methods
- Implements keyboard navigation (up/down/accept)
- Provides `on_start_game` callback for game-specific behavior
- Handles continue game logic with save system
- Updates UI based on model state (disable continue if no saves)

✅ **`options_screen_view.gd`** - Full options screen implementation
- Extends BaseScreenView
- Creates OptionsScreenModel and OptionsScreenController
- Exports node paths for all settings UI elements
- Automatically syncs sliders/checkboxes with model state
- Handles volume, fullscreen, resolution, vsync settings
- Wires up back button to screen manager navigation
- Prevents signal loops with `set_value_no_signal()`

✅ **`save_load_screen_view.gd`** - Full save/load screen implementation
- Extends BaseScreenView
- Creates SaveLoadScreenModel and SaveLoadScreenController
- Dynamically creates slot buttons from model data
- Exports node paths and optional custom slot button scene
- Formats preview data for display
- Implements keyboard navigation
- Provides virtual methods for game-specific save/load handling
- Shows/hides delete button based on slot state

### 2. Game UI Structure

✅ **`game/ui/title_screen.tscn`**
- Updated to use `TitleScreenView` from core-game
- Renamed button to `StartButton` to match expected node path
- No custom script needed - pure UI definition

✅ **Game developers only need to:**
- Create .tscn files with UI layout in Godot editor
- Ensure node names match exported paths in view scripts
- Or customize node paths in inspector

### 3. Main Entry Point

✅ **`game/main.gd`** - Central game entry point
- Creates and manages ScreenManager instance
- Registers all screens with their .tscn paths
- Listens for screen transitions to configure them
- Sets up screen-specific callbacks and configurations
- Configures title screen's `on_start_game` callback to launch demo

✅ **`game/main.tscn`** - Main scene
- Simple Node with main.gd script attached
- Entry point for the entire application

### 4. Project Configuration

✅ **Updated `project.godot`**
- Main scene now points to `game/main.tscn`
- Application starts with proper initialization flow

### 5. Cleanup

✅ **Removed obsolete files:**
- `game/ui/title_screen.gd` (replaced by TitleScreenView)
- `game/ui/title_screen.gd.uid`

## New Architecture Flow

```
Start Game
    ↓
game/main.tscn + main.gd
    ↓
Creates ScreenManager
    ↓
Registers screens (title, options, save/load)
    ↓
Transitions to "title" screen
    ↓
Loads game/ui/title_screen.tscn
    ↓
TitleScreenView (from core-game/views/) initializes
    ↓
Creates Model + Controller
    ↓
Wires up UI elements
    ↓
Player clicks "Start"
    ↓
Controller triggers on_start_game callback
    ↓
main.gd handles transition to demo.tscn
```

## Benefits of New Architecture

### For Library (core-game/)
1. **Complete implementations** - Views handle all logic
2. **Reusable** - Same view code works across projects
3. **Extendable** - Game devs can override virtual methods
4. **Flexible** - Node paths are customizable via exports

### For Game Developers (game/)
1. **Simple UI design** - Just create .tscn in Godot editor
2. **No boilerplate** - No need to write view logic
3. **Easy customization** - Override callbacks in main.gd
4. **Clear entry point** - main.gd is the configuration hub

### Architecture Principles
1. **Separation of concerns** - Library provides logic, game provides UI
2. **Single responsibility** - Each component has one job
3. **Dependency inversion** - Views depend on abstractions (callbacks)
4. **Open/closed** - Open for extension, closed for modification

## Usage Examples

### Adding a New Screen to Your Game

1. **Create .tscn file** in `game/ui/` using Godot editor
2. **Design UI** with buttons, labels, etc.
3. **Name nodes** to match view's exported paths (or customize in inspector)
4. **Register in main.gd:**
```gdscript
func _register_screens() -> void:
    screen_manager.register_screen("title", "res://game/ui/title_screen.tscn")
    screen_manager.register_screen("options", "res://game/ui/options_screen.tscn")  # Add this
```

5. **Configure in main.gd:**
```gdscript
func _configure_options_screen() -> void:
    var options_view = screen_manager.current_screen as OptionsScreenView
    # Add custom configuration if needed
```

### Customizing Title Screen Behavior

In `game/main.gd`:
```gdscript
func _configure_title_screen() -> void:
    var title_view = screen_manager.current_screen as TitleScreenView
    
    # Set what happens when "Start" is clicked
    title_view.on_start_game = func():
        # Your custom logic here
        get_tree().change_scene_to_file("res://game/my_game.tscn")
```

### Navigating Between Screens

From any view with screen_manager access:
```gdscript
# Push to options (can go back)
controller.screen_manager.push_screen("options", "fade")

# Direct transition (replaces current)
controller.screen_manager.transition("title", "fade")

# Go back to previous screen
controller.screen_manager.pop_screen("slide_right")
```

```

## Testing Checklist

- [x] No linter errors
- [ ] Game starts with title screen
- [ ] "Start" button launches demo scene
- [ ] Keyboard navigation works (up/down/enter)
- [ ] Continue button disabled when no saves exist
- [ ] Screen manager transitions work
- [ ] Architecture is clean and maintainable

## Next Steps for Game Developers

1. **Test the current setup** - Run the game and click "Start"
2. **Create options screen UI** - Design `game/ui/options_screen.tscn`
3. **Add navigation** - Add Options button to title screen
4. **Create save/load screens** - Design save/load UI
5. **Implement SaveData** - Create game-specific save data class
6. **Customize callbacks** - Override view behaviors in main.gd

## Conclusion

The reorganization is complete! The architecture now provides:
- ✅ Complete view implementations in library
- ✅ Simple .tscn UI design for game developers
- ✅ Clear entry point with centralized configuration
- ✅ Clean separation between library and game code
- ✅ Easy to extend and customize

Game developers can now focus on designing beautiful UI in the Godot editor while the library handles all the complex logic! 🎮
